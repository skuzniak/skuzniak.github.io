        <h2>Senior Sitecore Developer</h2>
        <h3>sitecore@kuzniak.net</h3>
        <p>Hi,</p>
        <p>I have been working with Sitecore for 11 years. 
        I went all the way, from the good old classic Sitecore websites, to SXA based microsites, 
        to headless solutions and now I am bravely exploring the new world of Sitecore's Content Hub.</p>
        <p>In this blog I am writing about anything related to Sitecore, that I found challenging or interesting.</p>
        <p>I am happy to see you. I hope you will find what you need on my blog.</p>
